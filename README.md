# Visual-analysis-of-leaves-to-check-air-pollutants-through-deep-learning
Air pollution in India is a major health hazard. 22 out of 30 Indian cities are the most polluted cities in the world.According to a recent study it has been found that outdoor air pollution is the fifth-largest killer in India and around 1.2 million deaths occurred from air pollution-related diseases in 2017. Therefore it is necessary to monitor the quantities of different pollutants present in the air. Most of the contemporary pollution measurement techniques are either expensive and complex. 
Industries and vehicles emit pollutants that cause injuries, colour change to tree leaves. These changes can be visually observed. We considered this change as a parameter to check the air quality.The visual changes can depict the major constituents of air pollutants. An innovative and cost-efficient approach is needed to detect air quality. This paper gives an overview to detect air pollution due to change in colour of leaves because of common air pollutants using deep learning. We created a deep neural network and trained it on different leaves images and were able to detect the pollutants. The trained weights can be used to build software and mobile application.
